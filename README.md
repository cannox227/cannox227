# Hello 👋

If you have found this page cool, maybe you're into open source development or just a curious recruiter, anyway, you're welcome!

My name is Tommaso Canova, people know me also as __cannox__, my friends sometimes describe me as a funny dwarf, I don't know if they are right or not, in case we meet you may will discover it by yourself (just kidding, I'm not funny at all).

## 🤓 Something about me

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🎓 I'm attending the MSc in Artificial Intelligence at University of Trento

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🎓 On septembrer 2022 I've graduated in Computer and Electronic Engineering at University of Trento, with a grade of 110/110 cum laude

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;💻 I'm an Embedded Software Engineer at [E-Agle Trento Racing Team](https://github.com/eagletrt/), the [Formula SAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_SAE) team of UNITN

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🤖 I'm interested both in Embedded Systems - and Electronics in general - and in Artificial Intelligence

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🏉 I'm very keen on tech and electronics and I've been a rugby player until my 22 y.o.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✅ I'm a big fan of bullet lists
